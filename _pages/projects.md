    excerpt: "<strong>A Soft Body Physics Game Engine (OpenGL, C/C++)</strong><br><br>As my graduation thesis, I created a Game Engine which specializes in simulating soft body physics from scratch in C/C++. I designed the Engine's architecture so that it could build game projects using CMake, and created its 'Toybox' demo, which showcases different mesh soft bodies inside a Cornell Box with a custom GLSL shader I call 'gummy shader'."
