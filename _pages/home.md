    title: "Bio"
    excerpt: "I just graduated (Spring 2024) with a B.S. in Software Engineering from San Jose State University with Latin Honors. I'm extremely passionate about computer graphics, art, and working with the so many talented individuals around us. That's why I dream of building a career in technical art. 
    <br><br>
    I find immense joy in creating technology that allows us to unleash our imagination without bounds, and using it to create impactful works and stories that make others smile, from renders and feature films to video games. As they say in one famous studio, the technology drives the story, and the story drives the technology!
