    title: "Bio"
    excerpt: "🎓 B.S. Graduate (2024) <b>Software Engineering</b>, San Jose State University. <br><br>🏰 <b>Disney</b> intern, Orlando, FL. <br><br>💻 Actively seeking an associate <b>Technical Artist/TD</b> or related role.<br><br>
    I give artists superpowers with technology, and thrive from pushing the boundaries of what we think is technically possible. I love to learn and grow, striving to make creative visions a reality. As a famous studio says: <br><br><i>'The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art!'</i>
    <br><br>
    I also really like ramen 🍜, playing the piano 🎹, painting 🎨, and movies (especially animated!) 🎬."
